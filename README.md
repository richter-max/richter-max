# Hello, I'm Max
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/maximilian-richter-40697a298/"><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/-LinkedIn-0072b1?&style=for-the-badge&logo=linkedin&logoColor=white" /></a>  

I'm a 21-year-old German currently training as an IT Specialist in Application Development at Bosch (expected graduation: January 2026).

My main interests lie in **cybersecurity** and **software engineering** — with a strong focus on understanding systems deeply, breaking them intentionally, and designing them more robust afterwards.  
I’m especially interested in cloud security, web security, and security-oriented internal tooling.

## 🤝 Open to
- Freelance **security reviews** for small websites or SaaS products  
- **Smart contract** security analysis & exploit demonstrations  
- **Hackathons** (security, blockchain, DevOps)  
- **Open-source** contributions related to security or backend systems  
- **Dual study programs** in Computer Science or Cybersecurity  
- Entry-level or junior **cybersecurity roles**

---

## 🎯 Objective
Through my training and personal projects, I aim to build a strong practical foundation in cybersecurity.

My focus is on:
- understanding real-world attack paths
- automating security checks and visibility
- building small, purpose-driven tools that support decision-making

> Recently, I’ve been building a **[Cloud Pentest Lab](https://github.com/cleamax/cloud-pentest-lab)** to simulate realistic AWS misconfigurations and attack paths — from insecure IAM and S3 exposure to detection and mitigation workflows.
