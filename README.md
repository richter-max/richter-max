I'm a German IT Specialist in Application Development, currently completing my vocational training at Bosch  
(graduation: March 2026) and continuing with a **dual study program starting October 2026**.

My main interests are **cybersecurity** and **secure software engineering**, with a strong focus on understanding systems end-to-end, identifying weaknesses, and building practical tooling around security, visibility, and discipline.

---

## 🎯 Focus

My work and projects revolve around:
- cloud and web security fundamentals
- understanding realistic attack paths
- automation and internal tooling for clarity and control
- building small systems that support consistent decision-making

I prefer hands-on projects over theoretical abstractions and focus on tools I actually use.
