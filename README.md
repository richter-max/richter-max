I’m a German **IT Specialist in Application Development**.  
I completed my vocational training as a **Software Developer in January 2026** and will continue with a **dual B.Sc. program (Computer Science, Cybersecurity focus) starting October 2026**.

My work centers on **cybersecurity and secure software engineering**, with a strong emphasis on:
- understanding systems end-to-end
- identifying realistic attack paths and failure modes
- building **practical, explainable security tooling** for visibility, risk, and control

I optimize for **engineering signal**, not surface-level demos.

## What I Currently Focus On

Hands-on **security engineering**, especially:

- external attack surface analysis for cloud & SaaS systems  
- transport-layer security and configuration weaknesses  
- deterministic, explainable security signals over black-box scores  
- small, reliable tools that support consistent security decisions  

I strongly prefer **real systems** over purely theoretical abstractions.

## Flagship Project — AEGIS  
### LLM Safety Evaluation & Security Framework

**AEGIS** is my primary project and represents how I think about **security, risk, and evaluation at system level**.

It is a **provider-agnostic framework** for testing, benchmarking, and enforcing safety constraints in LLM-based systems — designed in the style of an **internal security platform**, not a demo.

**Core ideas:**
- explicit threat modeling for LLM misuse & policy violations  
- deterministic evaluation instead of ad-hoc prompting  
- clear separation between *policy*, *guardrails*, *execution*, and *judging*

**Key components:**
- CLI framework (`run`, `bench`, `eval`)
- trace-based executions (`trace.jsonl`) for reproducibility
- layered guardrails (keyword, semantic, staged)
- strict vs. permissive policy modes
- spec-driven evaluation scenarios
- staged scoring judge with transparent reasoning
- provider-agnostic LLM abstraction layer

**Engineering focus:**
- reproducibility & explainability  
- explicit trade-offs instead of hidden magic  
- clean internal APIs and testable components  

**Repository:**

This project is intentionally built to be **discussed deeply in security engineering interviews**.

## Other Projects (some maybe private)

### Security & Labs
- **Cloud Pentest Lab** — vulnerable AWS setups with detection strategies  
- **SOC Automation** — automated SIEM / SOAR workflows  
- **Attack Surface Scanner** — CI-focused lightweight web security scanner  
- **Blockchain Attack Playground** — vulnerable smart contracts with exploit write-ups  

### Personal Internal Tools
- **Arise** — performance & consistency tracking  
- **Candle** — rule-based trading execution & discipline enforcement  

Most of these systems are **private-first internal tools** that I actively use and iterate on.
